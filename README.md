# Overview

In 2005, an internet meme was started when a woman, trying to sell a TV, put a banana in her sale ad as a unit of measurement. Since then, ['Banana For Scale'](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/banana-for-scale) has grown in popularity and has been dubbed the ['yardstick of the internet.'](https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/banana-for-scale-meme-history/)

"Banana for Scale" has also been adapted to other objects. In this case, a double mattress!

So this got me thinking, what if you could use a banana as an actual unit for scale in an image?

# Data

Using my [website](http://www.bananaforscale.lol), I asked friends and family to help my out by uploading images of themselves holding bananas and their height.

As of December 20th, I have collected 148 images to use in my dataset. The average Height was 5'7".

Due to human nature, I had some duplicate photos, blurry photos, and jokesters who posed two people with one banana.
